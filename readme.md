Planned point-and-click-adventure.
More information will be added in this documentation as soon as it arrives.

This is all a WIP.


This game will be written in Love2D using my LoveBuilder.


Release plans:
- Mac
  1. The game will come in a full application bundle. 
  2. The game is being developed on Sierra, so at least it should work on there. I do expect High Sierra and any MacOS/MacOS X/OS X version to work as long as it is Yosemite or later. El Capitan is at least recommended.
  3. On Mac only 64 bit CPUs are supported. Well since the only MacOS X versions supporting 32 bit (since the switch to Intel processors) are Tiger, Leopard and maybe Snow Leopard, I don't expect trouble here.
  4. The game will be provided in zip, just drag the game to the applications folder. First time you run, RIGHT-CLICK the icon and select "Open". This is required because I don't pay approx a hundred bucks to Apple ~~to fill their wallets~~ as a sign you can trust me.
- Windows
  1. The first versions will only come zipped, but as a full appliction with everything you need in one directory.
  2. Installers may be provided for the full game only.
  3. OpenGL 2 is required at least, meaning some older Windows machines cannot run the game.
- Linux
  1. For Linux users only get the Morker.linux.love file
  2. Meaning you will have to install Love2d version 0.10.2 as a dependency.
     - This is by advice of the crew behind Love2D. Creating a fully functional game in Ubuntu can mean it won't work in OpenSUSE or Fedora. I said "can mean", as it might work it can only not be guaranteed. The Love2D crew therefore recommends you install Love2D always on the way your distro wants you to. Yeah, lack of standardisation is what Linux users want, and then you gotta deal with the downsides of it, sorry!
- Android
  1. The possibility to release the game for Android as well is being investigated. I cannot yet promise the game will run on Android. As Love2D is Android compatible the game should run, and the interface is being designed as much as possible to be "touchscreen friendly."
- iOS
  1. Since Love2D can run on iOS, so can this game, purely technically speaking
  2. The problem is the AppStore requirement. The license of this game is not yet decided(!), but if you find a way to get the game to work on iOS without breaking the license terms, I won't stop ya!
