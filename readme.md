# MÃ¶rker

Planned point-and-click-adventure.
More information will be added in this documentation as soon as it arrives.

This is all a WIP.



This game uses two components.
A launcher written in [http://github.com/tricky1975/maan](Maan)
And the game itself written in [https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/LAURA2](LAURA II)
This repository contains only the source files needed for these two components, the basics of possible databases, and the installers.
