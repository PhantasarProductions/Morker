Planned point-and-click-adventure.
More information will be added in this documentation as soon as it arrives.

This is all a WIP.

There are two ideas now:

## LAURA II

This game uses two components.
A launcher written in [http://github.com/tricky1975/maan](Maan)
And the game itself written in [https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/LAURA2](LAURA II)
This repository contains only the source files needed for these two components, the basics of possible databases, and the installers.

## LOVE2D

This is still being studied as an option.
It will be decided later which of the two engines will be used.
