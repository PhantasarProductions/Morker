# Game Scripts

This folder will contain all game scripts in their specific subfolders.

Scripts that are very strictly set up for the game (most of all the "MapScripts") will very likely only be available for evaluation, but may only be distributed in unmodified form in an unmodified game.
Scripts that can have multiple purposes and can be very will usable outside the game may if stripped from ALL references to Kthura, Moerker and everything related to the Moerker universe, be used under the terms of the zLib license UNLESS stated otherwise inside the script files themselves.
